Added a FMS that has 3 states: 

1. Patrol, which is just a set
2. Seeking/Attack, which seeks out the player and attacks
3. Return to patrol, the dragon flys back to its patrol position

Also added player health indicator under player score and added controls info, objective list,
and a notes list on the start map. 

To run the game simply download all the code and files, and run the main function,
Controls are arrow keys to move, J to traverse object and Spacebar to attack.
